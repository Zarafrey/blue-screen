# blue-screen
A simple Google Apps Script plugin for inserting a blue screen into a Google Docs document. Intended for writing LitRPG novels.

This script, when added to a Google Docs document, will create a dropdown menu contianing a single option. Clicking this option will insert a simple blue screen at the location of the cursor in the document. This blue screen will contain simple filler text that can then be edited.

I have gone through the trouble of spending many minutes creating this script to save myself and others the fifteen seconds it would take to do this manually.
